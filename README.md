Discord bot that sends Zalando discount codes to your email.

*CONTACT ME ON DISCORD Sk4v#4331 IF YOU WANT A FASTER SOLUTIONS (1 code x second)*

This program generates Zalando discount codes using Selenium. This code is very simple and easy to understand.

YOU MUST USE "TRUE" EMAIL, RANDOM,TEMPORALLY AND CATCHALL EMAILS DON'T WORK. 

First of all you need to install selenium and discord.py...you can download them from requirement.txt.

Than you need to download the chromedriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) which is compatible with your chrome version (chrome://version).

Paste the chromedriver path on the variable PATH in the main.py file (ex: C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver.exe).

Your bot token is required (https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/), you need to paste it on the token variable on main.py file. 

Once the bot is online you can check if it is running using the following command.

By default the bot will create 5 discount codes but you can change the number to your liking...you just have to change the number_gen variable.

Program doesn't work in headless mode...but I'm working to fix this error. 

If you have any question or problem you can contact me!
